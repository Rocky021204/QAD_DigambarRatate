STAGE 1: SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
    - Checkout source code
    - Run SonarQube (or Bandit/ESLint/PMD depending on language)
    - IF critical vulnerabilities FOUND:
          STOP pipeline
          REPORT issue to developers
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 2: Dependency Vulnerability Scan
    - Scan dependencies (requirements.txt, package.json, pom.xml)
    - Use Snyk / OWASP Dependency-Check
    - IF high severity vulnerabilities FOUND:
          STOP pipeline
          CREATE issue in Jira/GitHub
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 3: Build & Container Security Scan
    - Build Docker image of application
    - Scan image with Trivy/Aqua/Clair
    - IF insecure image FOUND:
          STOP pipeline
          ALERT security team
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 4: Deploy to Staging Environment
    - Deploy application to staging server (Kubernetes/Docker)

STAGE 5: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
    - Run OWASP ZAP scan against staging app
    - IF runtime vulnerabilities FOUND:
          STOP pipeline
          SAVE report to dashboard
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 6: Automated Penetration Testing
    - Run Metasploit / Gauntlt scripts

          STOP pipeline
          CREATE incident report
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 7: Compliance Checks
    - Run OpenSCAP / Checkov / custom compliance scripts
    - Validate against OWASP, GDPR, ISO standards
    - IF compliance FAIL:
          STOP pipeline
          GENERATE compliance violation report
    - ELSE CONTINUE

STAGE 8: Reporting & Notifications
    - Aggregate reports from SAST, Dependency, DAST, Pen Testing, Compliance
    - Generate unified dashboard + send email/Slack alerts
    - Auto-create Jira/GitHub issues for remediation

STAGE 9: Deployment
    - IF all previous stages PASSED:
          Deploy to PRODUCTION
    - ELSE:
